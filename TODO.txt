NEXT MEETING: 5/16


5/9 Meeting
Since last meeting:
	-Implemented:
		-Hidden rows integrity maintainer
		-Merged cells integrity maintainer
	
Current Objective: 
--------------------------------
By Thursday:
	- Iron out merger/hider details [data offset? ? ?]
	- Double check sourcing schedules, permissions
	- On schedule title: no use for start and end date
--------------------------------
	- Backup system
	- Progress bar 
	- look into increasing flexibility around human error
	- standardize font and font size
	- justify dates to the right
	- normalize date formats ( mm/dd/yy )
	- think of adding UI for choosing single file or folder
	
Potentially Sneaky Things to Work Around
- Sneaky column B thinger on CISD [line 25 has hidden 3 in column B)
- Sneaky characters mis placed characters [BAMCCBS cell C12]

New solution for hidden files [EDIT: 5/9 IMPLEMENTED]
- Openpyxl does not support preserving the hidden rows when inserting new rows (Confirmed through email)
To maintain integrity of the excel file:
	- read existing data in target worksheet
	- store it in memory 
	- write new schedule at the top
	- write stored data below the new schedule 
	Potential Pitfalls
	- Loss of integrity of hidden rows when pulled from memory

PLAN B
Tammy has access to a database with the course data
provided in a more 'stripped down' fashion by an algo.
If working around man-made schedules too challenging,
consider following Tammy's plan B. 

NOTIFY Tammy

ASK
How to format the title cells going forward? copy style from previous calendar?
