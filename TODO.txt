NEXT MEETING: 5/2
Tammy requested update following a similar format as below. 

Since last meeting:
	-Researched potential solutions
	-Fixed worksheet selection bug
	
Current Objective: 
	- increase universality of program / reduce necessity for rigid format
	- retain complete integrity of previous schedules
	
	
Potentially Sneaky Things to Work Around

- Sneaky column B thinger on CISD [line 25 has hidden 3 in column B)
- Sneaky characters mis placed characters [BAMCCBS cell C12]

New solution for hidden files
- Openpyxl does not support preserving the hidden rows when inserting new rows (Confirmed through email)
To maintain integrity of the excel file:
	- read existing data in target worksheet
	- store it in memory 
	- write new schedule at the top
	- write stored data below the new schedule 

	Potential Pitfalls
	- Loss of integrity of hidden rows when pulled from memory

PLAN B
Tammy has access to a database with the course data
provided in a more 'stripped down' fashion by an algo.
If working around man-made schedules too challenging,
consider following Tammy's plan B.
